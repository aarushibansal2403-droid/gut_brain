!Series_summary	"Stress exerts profound impacts on the gastrointestinal tract, yet its effects on intestinal stem cells (ISCs) have not been fully explored. Here, we unveiled a notable reduction in both the quantity and proliferative capacity of ISCs under chronic stress condition, which was mediated by elevated corticosterone levels resulting from the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Mechanistically, corticosterone directly impairs ISCs by interacting with its receptor, nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group c member 1 (NR3C1), which promoted FKBP prolyl isomerase 5 (FKBP5) expression to negatively regulate the AKT activation by mediating the dephosphorylation at the Ser473, thus enhancing the nuclear translocation of the forkhead box O (FoxO) to inhibit the proliferative activity. Collectively, these findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the deleterious effects of psychological stress on gut, and underscore corticosterone as a key mediator linking stress to ISCs dysfunction."
!Series_overall_design	"To deeply deciphered the molecular mechanisms that drives the deleterious effect of stress on ISCs via corticosterone, we conducted RNA-seq on Lgr5-GFPhi ISCs purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from mice subjected to once exposure to either restraint stress or corticosterone injection. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 12 different ISCs. Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Ctrl versus CRS ISCs, and Vehicle versus CORT ISCs."
